/*
 * b2-sdk-typescript x large.parallel_download -- conformance check.
 *
 * The contract is bin/conformance/README.md; the worked reference is
 * bin/conformance/b2-sdk-python/files.upload. Neither is negotiable here.
 *
 * Scenario (approved 2026-09-22, one per capability, identical on every tool
 * that claims it):
 *
 *   Setup   a large object
 *   Action  download it with multiple streams
 *   Assert  the bytes are correct and more than one concurrent ranged GET is
 *           observed
 *
 * DOCS -- b2_download_file_by_id, Range: "A byte-range request that returns
 * part of the stored file. NOTE: Only byte-range requests with a single range
 * of bytes are supported." and "The status code for a successful response to
 * a Range request is 206 Partial Content when only part of the stored file is
 * returned." https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/b2-download-file-by-id
 * Parallelism is PERMITTED: "You can use the URL and authorization token that
 * are returned from the b2_authorize_account operation by multiple downloading
 * threads. You can download in parallel to increase overall throughput."
 * https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-download-files-with-the-native-api
 * PERMISSION ONLY: no B2 document requires a client to download in parallel,
 * so the ">1 concurrent ranged GET" expected value traces to the tool's
 * stream setting, not to B2.
 *
 * TARGET -- why this slug always says @simulator.
 * b2-sdk-typescript does not target a B2 realm from this harness. Every check
 * here drives the SDK's real HTTP path against the harness's own B2 simulator
 * (bin/simulator/serve.mjs), started fresh for this check by
 * bin/run-conformance.sh --target simulator and named in
 * CONFORMANCE_SIMULATOR_URL. So the line below reports @simulator whatever
 * CONFORMANCE_TARGET asks for, and without that URL it reports
 * no-realm-option. A simulator PASS is WEAKER evidence than a staging PASS: it
 * says the SDK and the harness's simulator agree, not that real B2 agrees.
 *
 * It exercises this checkout through the @backblaze-labs/b2-sdk package
 * self-reference after the exact revision has been built. The API was taken
 * from docs/sdks/b2-sdk-typescript/card.md (which carries path:line citations)
 * and the package's published types.
