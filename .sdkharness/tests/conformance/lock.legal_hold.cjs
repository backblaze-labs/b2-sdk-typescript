/*
 * b2-sdk-typescript x lock.legal_hold -- conformance check.
 *
 * The contract is bin/conformance/README.md; the worked reference is
 * bin/conformance/b2-sdk-python/files.upload. Neither is negotiable here.
 *
 * Scenario (approved 2026-09-22, one per capability, identical on every tool
 * that claims it):
 *
 *   Setup   a lock-enabled bucket and an object in it
 *   Action  set the hold on, read it back, set it off
 *   Assert  on -> delete is refused and the read-back says on;
 *           off -> delete is permitted
 *
 * The expected value is B2's published contract. b2_update_file_legal_hold takes
 * legalHold "on" to enable legal hold for the file, "off" to disable it", and is
 * "Used to enable legal hold for a file in an Object Lock-enabled bucket,
 * preventing it from being deleted, or to disable legal hold protections":
 * https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/b2-update-file-legal-hold
 * "If either legal hold or retention settings, or even both, are active for a
 * given file, then that file is protected from being deleted."
 * https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-object-lock
 *
 * TARGET -- why this slug always says @simulator.
 * b2-sdk-typescript does not target a B2 realm from this harness. Every check
 * here drives the SDK's real HTTP path against the harness's own B2 simulator
 * (bin/simulator/serve.mjs), started fresh for this check by
 * bin/run-conformance.sh --target simulator and named in
 * CONFORMANCE_SIMULATOR_URL. So the line below reports @simulator whatever
 * CONFORMANCE_TARGET asks for, and without that URL it reports
 * no-realm-option. A simulator PASS is WEAKER evidence than a staging PASS: it
 * says the SDK and the harness's simulator agree, not that real B2 agrees.
 *
 * It exercises this checkout through the @backblaze-labs/b2-sdk package
 * self-reference after the exact revision has been built. The API was taken
 * from docs/sdks/b2-sdk-typescript/card.md (which carries path:line citations)
 * and the package's published types.
