/*
 * b2-sdk-typescript x lock.bucket_default -- conformance check.
 *
 * The contract is bin/conformance/README.md; the worked reference is
 * bin/conformance/b2-sdk-python/files.upload. Neither is negotiable here.
 *
 * Scenario (approved 2026-09-22, one per capability, identical on every tool
 * that claims it):
 *
 *   Setup   a file-lock-enabled bucket
 *   Action  set default retention governance / 1 day
 *   Assert  the read-back reports mode and period; a newly uploaded object
 *           inherits retention at about now + 1 day
 *
 * The expected values are B2's published contract, not this simulator's
 * behaviour: https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-object-lock --
 * "All of the files that are uploaded or copied to that bucket, from that
 * time on, are protected by those Object Lock retention settings by
 * default." Read-back shape from
 * https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-enable-object-lock-with-the-native-api:
 * defaultRetention { mode, period { duration, unit } }.
 *
 * This is the check that found the gap: the embedded SDK test server
 * round-trips the bucket default correctly but does not apply it to a newly
 * uploaded object, which the quote above says it must. Filed and open:
 * https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript/issues/303. The FAIL
 * below is the simulator failing to honour B2's own documented contract --
 * do not soften this assertion to match the simulator's current behaviour.
 *
 * TARGET -- why this slug always says @simulator.
 * b2-sdk-typescript does not target a B2 realm from this harness. Every check
 * here drives the SDK's real HTTP path against the harness's own B2 simulator
 * (bin/simulator/serve.mjs), started fresh for this check by
 * bin/run-conformance.sh --target simulator and named in
 * CONFORMANCE_SIMULATOR_URL. So the line below reports @simulator whatever
 * CONFORMANCE_TARGET asks for, and without that URL it reports
 * no-realm-option. A simulator PASS is WEAKER evidence than a staging PASS: it
 * says the SDK and the harness's simulator agree, not that real B2 agrees.
 *
 * It exercises this checkout through the @backblaze-labs/b2-sdk package
 * self-reference after the exact revision has been built. The API was taken
 * from docs/sdks/b2-sdk-typescript/card.md (which carries path:line citations)
 * and the package's published types.
